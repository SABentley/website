			<p class="aboutmetext">Hello and welcome to my website!</p>
			<p class="aboutmetext">My name is Sheldon Bentley. I currently work at Electronic Arts Canada as web store QA on Origin.</p>
			<p class="aboutmetext">Video games have been a huge hobby for me since I could remember. I've always wanted to work in the video games industry and to learn more about how games were made. My favourite video games are mostly 90's CRPG games like Fallout, Planescape and Arcanum. I'm also a fan of most platformers that were released on Nintendo 64 (Goemon's Great Adventure is my favourite).</p>
			<p class="aboutmetext">In September 2013, I graduated from the Art Institute of Vancouver in Visual and Game Programming. I've created some games, either alone or with a team, and you can see some of these games on my "Projects" page.</p>
			<p class="aboutmetext">My other favourite hobby is MMA. I've been training since I was 17 years old and I've been hooked ever since. The physical progressions I make from training are what drive me. I'm proficient in Muay Thai Kickboxing, Boxing, No-Gi Jiu-Jitsu and Wrestling.</p>
